                    <h3>People say nothing is impossible, <br>but I do nothing every day.</h3>
                    <p>I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I dream of managing time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.</p>

The remaining ten percent also takes 90 percent of the time and the final touches also take 90 percent of the time.I met a web developer the other day and ran away as quickly as possible cause I'm scared of spiders</p>
